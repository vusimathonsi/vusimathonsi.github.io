					<h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
					<p>
						I believe that true education happens as much on the
						sports field, the stage, and in the corridors of the
						boarding house as it does at the chalkboard.
					</p>
					<p>
						I see my role as creating a safe, structured environment
						where young people learn the value of accountability,
						community, and self-respect.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						High standards require high support.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Whether I am guiding a student through a difficult
						equation or a difficult personal decision, I am there to
						provide the firm boundaries they need to feel secure,
						and the relational warmth they need to thrive.
					</p>

						<p class="card-text">
							Mathematics is often a source of anxiety for
							students. I turn it into a source of confidence. My
							classroom is a space where "I can't" is replaced by
							"I haven't solved it yet." By breaking down complex
							concepts into logical steps, I help students not
							only master the curriculum but develop the critical
							thinking skills they will use for the rest of their
							lives.

							A boarding house is more than a place to sleep; it

							Adolescence is a pivotal transition. As a mentor, I
							walk alongside students as they navigate the
							pressure of expectations and the search for
							identity. Whether on the sports field or in a quiet
							one-on-one conversation, I challenge them to look
							beyond the immediate and envision the men they want
							to become - grounded in integrity and driven by
							purpose.
