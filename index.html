					<h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
					<p>
						I believe that true education happens as much in the
						corridors of the boarding house as it does at the
						chalkboard. As a Mathematics Educator, I demand rigour
						and clarity, teaching students that complex problems are
						solvable with patience and logic. As a Housemaster and
						Mentor, I translate that same approach into life skills
						- creating a safe, structured environment where young
						people learn the value of accountability, community, and
						self-respect.
					</p>
					<p>
						My approach is built on a simple philosophy:
						<strong>high standards require high support</strong>.
						Whether I am guiding a student through a difficult
						equation or a difficult personal decision, I am there to
						provide the firm boundaries they need to feel secure,
						and the relational warmth they need to thrive.
